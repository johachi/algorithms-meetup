# Summary

This repository contains all my solutions for the Algorithms Meetup held by [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/). Almost all coding challenges are language agnostic, but I have chosen to solve them in JavaScript (to begin with at least).

Original readme can be found at the [forked repository](https://github.com/codechrysalis/algorithms-meetup).

# Setup
Clone repository and then run `yarn` in the command line.

# Run tests
This repository is using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) with [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).

To run the tests, run `yarn test` in the command line.
