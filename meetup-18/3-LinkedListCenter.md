# Find the Middle Node of a Singly Linked List

## Summary

You are given a Singly Linked List of unknown length. Find the middle node.

## Input

Your algorithm will be given an item that points to the first item of a linked list.

## Output

The output will be the value of the middle node

## Example

Node:
```
{
  value: number,
  next: address
}
```

```
Linked List:
root = 
{
  value: 1,
  next: {
    value: 2,
    next: {
      value: 3,
      next: null
    }
  }
}
```

```
Input:
findMiddle(root)

Output:
2
```

## Constraints

You can only iterate through the Linked List once

## Tips

The Linked List is written in a JavaScript format, but feel free to implement your own Linked List.
